# Security Policy

Use Github security reporting. It will promptly be reviewed and adressed accordingly.
If I have not enabled this for the repository, raise an issue for that, and I will get that done.
Please do not submit security problems as github issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please adhare to [Responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) which enhances security for the entire community.

I strongly recommend users of my libraries to use [Scala Steward](https://github.com/fthomas/scala-steward) or something similar to 
automatically receive updates.
